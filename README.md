# Route Optimization

Single FastAPI service on Cloud Run that geocodes consignments and builds a delivery sequence for a DRS.

It replaces the previous two Cloud Functions (`save_consignments` and `run_sorting`) with one service and two HTTP endpoints.

## What it does

1. **Save** — load consignments from Firestore, geocode receiver addresses with Google Maps, upsert rows into BigQuery, then sync `consignments_routing` back to Firestore.
2. **Sort** — load active consignments for a DRS, solve an open-path TSP from the DRS starting point with OR-Tools, write sequence/cluster fields to BigQuery, then sync Firestore.

Typical order: save consignments first, then run sorting when the driver/hub starting point exists.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `POST` | `/save-consignments` | Geocode and persist consignments |
| `POST` | `/run-sorting` | Optimize route order for a DRS |
| `GET` | `/docs` | OpenAPI / Swagger UI |
| `GET` | `/redoc` | ReDoc |

### Save consignments

```http
POST /save-consignments
Content-Type: application/json

{ "consignmentIds": ["id1", "id2"] }
```

A single id is also accepted: `{ "consignmentId": "id1" }`.

Success (`200`):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "saved": 2,
  "failed": 0,
  "failures": [],
  "started_at": "...",
  "finished_at": "...",
  "duration_seconds": 1.23
}
```

`status` is `partial_success` when some ids fail geocoding or are missing. Failures are listed as `{ "consignmentId", "reason" }`. Missing body returns `400`; unexpected errors return `500`.

### Run sorting

```http
POST /run-sorting
Content-Type: application/json

{ "drsno": "DRS123" }
```

Query param `?drsno=` is also accepted.

Success (`200`):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "drsNo": "DRS123",
  "optimized_count": 40,
  "starting_time": "...",
  "ending_time": "...",
  "duration_seconds": 4.56
}
```

If there are no active BigQuery rows for that DRS, `optimized_count` is `0` and a `message` is returned.

## Data stores

| Store | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Firestore `consignments` | Source consignment documents |
| Firestore `drs_starting_point` | Hub/depot lat/lon and address, keyed by DRS number |
| Firestore `consignments_routing` | Routing snapshot synced after save/sort, keyed by `consignmentId` |
| BigQuery `consignments_routing` | System of record for geocode fields, sequence, and clusters |

Save writes geocode data and leaves grouping as `UNASSIGNED` with `starting_*` placeholders. Sort fills `geohash_group_id`, `planned_*` / `actual_*` sequence, and the real starting point.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Yes (save) | — | Geocoding API key |
| `BQ_PROJECT` | No | `prj-dev-hermes` | GCP project for BigQuery |
| `BQ_DATASET` | No | `Hermes_Exports` | BigQuery dataset |
| `BQ_TABLE` | No | `consignments_routing_test` | BigQuery table |
| `FIRESTORE_PROJECT` | No | same as `BQ_PROJECT` | Firestore project |
| `PORT` | Cloud Run | `8080` | HTTP port |

The runtime service account needs BigQuery Data Editor (or equivalent query/update on the table) and Firestore read/write on the collections above.

## Local run

Python 3.11+ and Application Default Credentials (for example `gcloud auth application-default login`).

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

$env:GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY"
$env:BQ_PROJECT = "prj-dev-hermes"
$env:BQ_DATASET = "Hermes_Exports"
$env:BQ_TABLE = "consignments_routing_test"
$env:FIRESTORE_PROJECT = "prj-dev-hermes"

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/docs or use the curl / Postman steps below (skip the `Authorization` header for local).

## Deploy to Cloud Run

From this directory:

```powershell
gcloud run deploy route-optimization `
  --source . `
  --region asia-south1 `
  --timeout 300 `
  --set-env-vars "BQ_PROJECT=prj-dev-hermes,BQ_DATASET=Hermes_Exports,BQ_TABLE=consignments_routing_test,FIRESTORE_PROJECT=prj-dev-hermes,GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY"
```

Prefer Secret Manager for the Maps key in production instead of `--set-env-vars`. Raise `--timeout` and memory if DRS batches are large; sorting time grows with stop count (OR-Tools search is capped at 1–5 seconds internally).

After deploy, call:

- `https://<service-url>/health`
- `https://<service-url>/save-consignments`
- `https://<service-url>/run-sorting`

## Testing

Set the base URL. For local use `http://localhost:8080`. For Cloud Run:

```powershell
$base = "https://route-optimization-567483485783.asia-south1.run.app"
```

If the service was deployed **without** `--allow-unauthenticated`, every request needs a Bearer token:

```powershell
$token = gcloud auth print-identity-token
```

The token expires in about an hour. Re-run `print-identity-token` if you get `401` or `403`.

On Windows PowerShell, do **not** put JSON inline in `curl.exe -d '...'`. PowerShell strips quotes and FastAPI returns `json_invalid`. Write the body to a file instead.

### curl — health

```powershell
curl.exe -sS -X GET "$base/health" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok"}`

### curl — save consignments

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$pwd\save-body.json", '{"consignmentIds":["HRD363615390"]}')

curl.exe -g -sS -m 300 -X POST "$base/save-consignments" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --data-binary "@save-body.json"
```

Single consignment:

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$pwd\save-body.json", '{"consignmentId":"HRD363615390"}')
```

Several consignments:

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$pwd\save-body.json", '{"consignmentIds":["HRD363615390","HRD363615391"]}')
```

### curl — run sorting

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$pwd\sort-body.json", '{"drsno":"DRS123"}')

curl.exe -g -sS -m 300 -X POST "$base/run-sorting" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --data-binary "@sort-body.json"
```

Or pass DRS as a query param:

```powershell
curl.exe -g -sS -m 300 -X POST "$base/run-sorting?drsno=DRS123" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
```

### curl — Linux / macOS / Git Bash

Quotes work normally here. Still use `-g` so `[...]` is not treated as a URL range.

```bash
BASE="https://route-optimization-567483485783.asia-south1.run.app"
TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)"

curl -sS -X GET "$BASE/health" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

curl -g -sS -m 300 -X POST "$BASE/save-consignments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"consignmentIds":["HRD363615390"]}'

curl -g -sS -m 300 -X POST "$BASE/run-sorting" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"drsno":"DRS123"}'
```

Local (no token):

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health
curl -g -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/save-consignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"consignmentIds":["HRD363615390"]}'
curl -g -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/run-sorting \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"drsno":"DRS123"}'
```

### Postman

1. Create a collection, e.g. **Route Optimization**.
2. Add a collection variable `baseUrl` = `https://route-optimization-567483485783.asia-south1.run.app` (or `http://localhost:8080`).
3. **Auth (Cloud Run only)**  
   - In the collection **Authorization** tab, type **Bearer Token**.  
   - Token value: run `gcloud auth print-identity-token` in a terminal and paste the output.  
   - Child requests can use **Inherit auth from parent**.  
   - For local, set Authorization to **No Auth**.
4. Create three requests:

**Health**

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Method | `GET` |
| URL | `{{baseUrl}}/health` |

**Save consignments**

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Method | `POST` |
| URL | `{{baseUrl}}/save-consignments` |
| Headers | `Content-Type: application/json` |
| Body | **raw** → **JSON** |

```json
{
  "consignmentIds": ["HRD363615390"]
}
```

**Run sorting**

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Method | `POST` |
| URL | `{{baseUrl}}/run-sorting` |
| Headers | `Content-Type: application/json` |
| Body | **raw** → **JSON** |

```json
{
  "drsno": "DRS123"
}
```

5. Send. Typical results:
   - `200` with `"status": "ok"` or `"partial_success"` — request reached the app.
   - `401` / `403` — missing or expired token, or your user lacks `roles/run.invoker`.
   - `400` — missing `consignmentIds` / `drsno`.
   - `500` with a BigQuery `Name ... not found inside T` — the target table is missing a column (for example `geocode_address`).

Save can take a while (geocoding). In Postman set **Settings → Request timeout** high enough (e.g. 300000 ms), matching Cloud Run `--timeout 300`.
